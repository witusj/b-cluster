## Introduction {#intro .unnumbered}

This *pinp is not PNAS* template started when the introduction to
[Rcpp](http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.html) by \cite{PeerJ:Rcpp} 
was converted into this updated
[Rcpp Introduction](https://eddelbuettel.github.io/pinp/Rcpp-introduction.pdf)
vignette.  It is based on the
[pnas_article](https://github.com/rstudio/rticles/tree/master/inst/rmarkdown/templates/pnas_article)
template of the wonderful [rticles](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rticles) package by
\cite{CRAN:rticles}. The conversion from markdown to latex is facilitated by
[rmarkdown](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rmarkdown)
\citep{CRAN:rmarkdown} and [knitr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=knitr)
\citep{CRAN:knitr}. The underlying LaTeX macros are from
[pnas.org](http://www.pnas.org/site/authors/latex.xhtml).

The remainder of the document carries over from the corresponding
[pnas_article](https://github.com/rstudio/rticles/tree/master/inst/rmarkdown/templates/pnas_article)
template document. but has been edited and updated to our use case.  A
few specific tips follow.  In general, for fine-tuning some knowledge
of LaTeX is helpful.

Please note that LaTeX typesetting in two-column mode with several
floating objects can be fragile.  You may need to iterate.


## Author Affiliations {#author-affiliations .unnumbered}

Per common academic best practice, you can include your department,
institution, and complete address, with the ZIP/postal code, for each
author. Use lower case letters to match authors with institutions, as
shown in the example. Authors with an ORCID ID may supply this
information at submission.

## Document Options

We support several options via the YAML header

- Setting a DOI or URL footer, for example for the CRAN package URL,
  which is placed in the bottom-left footer of the title page and even pages;
- Setting a footer label, for example _YourPackage Vignette_ stating
  your package, which is placed in the bottom-right footer on odd
  pages;
- Setting a free-form author field used on the inside footer;
- Optional _Draft_ watermarking;

<!-- ## Format {#format .unnumbered}

Many authors find it useful to organize their manuscripts with the
following order of sections; Title, Author Affiliation, Keywords,
Abstract, Significance Statement, Results, Discussion, Materials and
methods, Acknowledgments, and References. Other orders and headings are
permitted. -->


## References {#references .unnumbered}

Here we differ from PNAS and suggest natbib. References will appear in
author-year form. Use `\citet{}`, `\citep{}`, etc as usual.

We default to the `Chicago.bst` style. To switch to a different bibliography
style, please use `biblio-style: style` in the YAML header.


## Inline R Code {#inliner .unnumbered}

The PNAS sample included a fixed PNG image here, but this document prefers
to show the results and embedding of _R_ code. 

```{r figex, fig.width=3, fig.height=3, cache=TRUE, echo=TRUE, fig.cap="Narrow ggplot2 figure"}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) +
    geom_point(size=3, aes(colour=factor(cyl))) +
    theme(legend.position="none")
```

Here we use a standard knitr bloc with explicit options for

- figure width and height (`fig.width`, `fig.height`), both set to three inches;
- whether the code is shown (`echo=TRUE`); and
- the caption (`fig.cap`) as shown above.


## Digital Figures {#sec:figures .unnumbered}

Markdown, Pandoc and LaTeX support `.eps` and `.pdf` files.

Figures and Tables should be labelled and referenced in the standard way
using the `\label{}` and `\ref{}` commands.

The R examples above show how to insert a column-wide
figure. To insert a figure wider than one column, please use the
`\begin{figure*}...\end{figure*}` environment. 

One (roundabout) way of doing this is to _not_ actually plot a figure, but to
save it in a file as the following segment shows:

```{r densityPlot, echo=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
p <- ggplot(data = midwest,
            mapping = aes(x = area,
                          fill = state,
                          color = state)) +
    geom_density(alpha = 0.3)
## save to file
suppressMessages(ggsave("densities.pdf", p))
```

This file is then included via standard LaTeX commands.

\begin{figure*}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth, height=4in]{densities} 
  \end{center}
  \caption{Wide ggplot2 figure}\label{fig}
\end{figure*}


## Typeset Code (But Do Not Run It) {#typeset .unnumbered}

We can also just show code.

```r
xx <- faithful[,"eruptions"]
fit <- density(xx)
plot(fit)
```

This simply used a pandoc bloc started and ended by tree backticks,
with `r` as the language choice.  Similarly, _many_ other languages
can be typset directly simply by relying on pandoc.


## Single column equations {#single-column-equations .unnumbered}

Authors may use 1- or 2-column equations in their article, according to
their preference.

To allow an equation to span both columns, options are to use the
`\begin{figure*}...\end{figure*}` environment mentioned above for
figures, or to use the `\begin{widetext}...\end{widetext}` environment
as shown in equation \ref{eqn:example} below.

Please note that this option may run into problems with floats and
footnotes, as mentioned in the [cuted package
documentation](http://texdoc.net/pkg/cuted). In the case of problems
with footnotes, it may be possible to correct the situation using
commands `\footnotemark` and `\footnotetext`.

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
(x+y)^3&=(x+y)(x+y)^2\\
       &=(x+y)(x^2+2xy+y^2) \\
       &=x^3+3x^2y+3xy^3+x^3. 
       \label{eqn:example} 
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}


<!-- pandoc writes all tables using longtable, which fails in 2-column mode
